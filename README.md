*Warning*: Instagram has made scraping really difficuly/nearly impossible. This
tool may not work as intended. We would like to fix it but as Instagram is 
actively trying to prevent scraping this may not be possible. Apologies!

# DMI Instagram Scraper
This package provides a simple GUI on top of 
[instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io). Instaloader is a great Instagram 
scraper, but it requires familiarity with command-line interfaces or Python to
use. For people who do not have that familiarity, this GUI makes it possible to
scrape Instagram and easily collect all scraped data in a single CSV file with
metadata.

The scrape runs from the user's own computer. This can be contrasted with tools
like [4CAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat), which run 
scrapes from a central server. The disadvantage of that approach is that 
Instagram's aggressive rate limiting kicks in quickly if many scrapes are run 
from a central server. By using this app, all scrapes are run from the local 
computer, hopefully preventing rate limiting from being too obstructive.

CSV files generated by the DMI Instagram Scraper can be imported into 4CAT for
further analysis.

There is a 
[FAQ](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-instascraper/wiki/FAQ)
with some more information on the application.

## Installation

### Via pip

### Via pre-packaged binaries
This is the simplest way of running the app; download the application file and 
run it.

One-file binaries for Windows and macOS are (or will soon be) provided on the
